# Contributing
Want to contribute? We'd love your help - just follow these simple guidelines for contributing success.

## Contributor License Agreement
---
Python-Pyre uses GitHub's CLA. In brief, when you submit code for merging into the project, you confirm that:

 * Anyone can use your contributions anywhere, for free, forever.
 * Your contributions do not infringe on anyone else's rights.

GitHub's CLA gives project maintainers assurances about where contributions are coming from and what rights are being granted along with them. Therefore we want everyone to know before they contribute, so no one is caught out and everyone is happy.

## Code Reviews
---
When your code is submitted it will under-go a review before being merged. Providing details of the changes you've made and how they affect the program (and how to use the additions, if applicable) will speed up the review process and ensure your code gets merged faster.
We use GitHub Pull-Requests to manage these submissions, so ensure your fork of the project is kept updated alongside the current version. If your code is based of an old version you might not have your Pull-Request accepted (but you'll be told why at the time).
